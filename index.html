                    <p>
                        In REL 372 "Gendered Authority in American Religion" we discussed 
                        many places over time that women have held limited religious authority in unique 
                        social spaces. As I scroll through my social medias, I can’t help but wonder if 
                        this is a modern space for Latter Day Saint women to contribute to religious authority in
                        their social circles. This webpage is a summary of the research I performed for the final 
                        project in REL 327.

                    <h2>Social Media Experiment</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to know exactly how hard it was to create just three photos that
                        were close to the quality of the photos I saw on my social media. After the 
                        help from three friends, $100 on new clothes, 2 hours of hair and makeup, 
                        one hour of taking photos, and three hours of editing I was able to produce three photos.
                        Not surprisingly, this experiment was not easy. Through this process, I have gained a new
                        respect for the women on the pages I see every day. It is a big commitment to post every day
                        on social media and even bigger commitment to create crafted uniform content. This lead
                        me to ask, why do some LDS women spend so much time crafting their online persona, and is it part
                        of their personal religious expression?</p>

                    <h4>A *fake* story of Martha-Anne: </h4>
                        <p>Martha-Anne was always a sweet, faithful, LDS woman. She attended church, 
                        she was baptized at the appropriate age, and she was excited to attend BYU
                        to hopefully meet a good LDS man after his mission trip. Her path seemed to be aligning
                        with her dreams when she met John (pic 1). They quickly got engaged and Martha-Anne and John
                        seemed like the perfect couple, but there was trouble in paradise. Staying private to the world,
                        Martha-Anne posts a photo with her girlfriends (pic 2), she is happy with them, but her caption indicates
                        she is having a hard time. Finally, Instagram was shocked by her last post. Martha-Anne, still faithful
                        in her religion, has decided to open up about her sexuality (pic 3). After months of discussion, Martha-Anne
                        and John have realized that they are both part of the LGBTQ community. Though they will not get married,
                        both ex-lovers are committed to helping each other through these new waters. #loveislove

                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        Women of all religions have found religious authority in uncommon or "unofficial"
                        spaces throughout time. To understand the religious history of America means to understand
                        the religious history of women, and often that means looking at uncommon places. Will future
                        research look to LDS social media in the hopes of gaining a well-rounded view of their religious
                        history or will research still be inclined to analyze "official" sources of religion?
